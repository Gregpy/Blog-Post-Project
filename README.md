# Blog-Post-Project

## Installation

All libaries are included in Anaconda distribution. The code works with Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

Stackoverflow survey data from 2017 was used to analyze:

* Does undergrad major correlate with job security concerns.
* Does formal education correlate with job security concerns.
* Does parent education correlate with job security concerns. 

The results showed no correlations.

## File Descriptions

The notebook "Write a Data Science Blog Post Project" is the only file used. Comments and markdown cells were used to explain the code. 

## How to Interact with the Project

The cells can all be run in a linearly fashion. The code could be applied to other features as well. The mean and standard deviation of job security concern ratings were given depending on feature values to look for trends in the data. No trends were visibly apparent.

## Licensing and Acnknowledgements

The data was collected by Stackoverflow. Licensing and and information on the data can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data). Feel free to use the code otherwise.
